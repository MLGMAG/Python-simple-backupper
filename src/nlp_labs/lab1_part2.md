## Description

There is a dataset from the [Yakaboo](https://1drv.ms/f/s!AgoiFOsRix8LcYNBl26rru8wGGo).  

Dataset consists of the books descriptions and reviews.  

Implement the books recommendation system based on the similar ***description*** and ***positive comments***.  

The logic should be implemented with help of the ***tf-idf*** measurement.  

You can also use more advanced methods, but need to explain how they work.  

Additionally count the number of positive and negative comments and display its rating on a 5-point scale for each book.
